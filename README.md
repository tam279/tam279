I'm a Full-Stack Web Developer specializing in the MERN stack, currently in my final semester of the Software Development Diploma at the Southern Alberta Institute of Technology (SAIT) in Calgary, Alberta. In addition, I'm enriching my skills through the Full-Stack Web Development program at Coder School. Passionate about coding and problem-solving, I'm committed to delivering high-quality, user-centric web solutions. As I approach graduation, I'm actively seeking opportunities where I can bring my strong technical skills and dedication to a dynamic development team.
